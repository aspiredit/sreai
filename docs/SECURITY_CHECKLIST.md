# Security Checklist for GitHub Pages Deployment

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Security Check

Since this is a **static site deployment**, ensure no sensitive data is included:

### 🔍 Files to Review

**Environment Files:**
- [ ] `.env` files are in `.gitignore`
- [ ] No `.env.local`, `.env.production` committed
- [ ] No API keys in environment variables

**Configuration Files:**
- [ ] No database credentials in config files
- [ ] No API secrets in client-side code
- [ ] No authentication tokens hardcoded

**Mock Data:**
- [ ] All passwords are fake/demo data
- [ ] All email addresses are example.com or similar
- [ ] All API endpoints are mock/placeholder

### 🚫 What NOT to Include in Static Sites

GitHub Pages serves **static files only**, so avoid:
- Real database connections
- Server-side authentication
- API keys (use environment variables in build process)
- Real user credentials
- Production configuration

### ✅ Safe for Static Deployment

These are safe to include:
- Mock/demo data
- Fake credentials for UI demonstration
- Client-side routing
- Static assets (images, CSS, JS)
- Public configuration (like base URLs)

### 🔧 Recommended .gitignore Additions

```gitignore
# Environment variables
.env
.env.local
.env.production
.env.staging

# Sensitive configuration
config/production.json
secrets/
*.key
*.pem

# Database files
*.db
*.sqlite

# Logs with potential sensitive data
logs/
*.log
npm-debug.log*

# IDE files that might contain sensitive data
.vscode/settings.json
.idea/
```

### 🛡️ GitHub Pages Security Notes

**What GitHub Pages Does:**
- Serves static files only
- No server-side processing
- No database access
- Public by default (unless private repo with Pro plan)

**Best Practices:**
- Use environment variables for build-time configuration
- Keep real credentials in GitHub Secrets (for Actions)
- Use mock data for demonstrations
- Review all committed files before pushing

### 🚀 For Production Deployment

When moving from demo to production:
1. Replace all mock data with real data sources
2. Set up proper environment variable management
3. Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive build-time data
4. Consider using a backend API for sensitive operations
5. Implement proper authentication (external service)

## ✅ Current Status: SAFE FOR DEMO

Since you confirmed this is mock data, the deployment is safe to proceed!
