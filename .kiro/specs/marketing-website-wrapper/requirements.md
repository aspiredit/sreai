# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the existing YESRE demo application into a comprehensive marketing website with professional navigation and landing pages. The current demo (admin/user dashboards) will become a subset of a larger marketing site that includes Home, About Us, Pricing, Demo, and Sign In sections. The design will incorporate best practices from companies like Airbnb and Anthropic, focusing on clean aesthetics, intuitive navigation, and conversion-optimized layouts.
