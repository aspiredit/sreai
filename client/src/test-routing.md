# Routing Test Plan

## Test the new routing structure:

1. **Marketing Homepage** (`/`)
   - Should show the new MarketingHomepage component
   - Should have "Try Demo" and "Learn More" buttons
   - "Try Demo" should navigate to `/demo/login`

2. **Demo Login** (`/demo/login`)
   - Should show the existing LoginPage with back button
   - Back button should return to `/` (marketing homepage)
   - Login should navigate to `/demo/admin` or `/demo/user`

3. **Demo Dashboards** (`/demo/admin`, `/demo/user`)
   - Should show existing AdminDashboard or UserDashboard
   - Logout should return to `/` (marketing homepage) instead of login

4. **Navigation State**
   - App should track whether user is in marketing or demo mode
   - State should reset properly when navigating between modes

## Manual Testing Steps:

1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Visit `http://localhost:3000/` - should see marketing homepage
3. Click "Try Demo" - should navigate to `/demo/login`
4. Click "Back to Homepage" - should return to `/`
5. Go to `/demo/login` and login with admin/AiWithCi@Oct03
6. Should navigate to `/demo/admin` and show admin dashboard
7. Click logout - should return to `/` (marketing homepage)

## Expected Behavior:
- All existing demo functionality preserved
- New marketing homepage as entry point
- Proper navigation between marketing and demo modes
- Clean URL structure with `/demo/` prefix for demo routes
