- ✅ Gradient animations for text effects
- ✅ Smooth transitions with cubic-bezier easing

### 7. **Performance Optimizations**
- ✅ `will-change: transform` for animated elements
- ✅ `transform` and `opacity` for GPU acceleration
- ✅ Passive scroll listeners for better performance
- ✅ RequestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
- ✅ Reduced motion support for accessibility

## Manual Testing Steps:

### 1. **Parallax Background Testing:**
- Visit `http://localhost:3000/`
- Scroll slowly through hero section
- Verify background elements move at different speeds
- Check floating particles animate independently
- Test on different screen sizes

### 2. **Scroll Animation Testing:**
- Scroll through each section slowly
- Verify elements fade in when entering viewport
- Check staggered animations trigger in sequence
- Test counter animations start when visible
- Verify animations don't repeat on scroll up/down

### 3. **Hover Effect Testing:**
- Hover over CTA buttons in hero section
- Test card hover effects in about section
- Verify icon animations on hover
- Check button lift and glow effects
- Test magnetic hover on interactive elements

### 4. **Counter Animation Testing:**
- Scroll to about section statistics
- Verify counters animate from 0 to target values
- Check easing function creates smooth counting
- Test different counter speeds and formats
- Verify counters trigger only once

### 5. **Staggered Animation Testing:**
- Watch hero section key features reveal
- Check about section values animate in sequence
- Verify team members appear with delays
- Test timing feels natural and not rushed
- Check animations work on mobile devices

### 6. **Performance Testing:**
- Test animations on slower devices
- Check for smooth 60fps performance
- Verify no layout thrashing during animations
- Test reduced motion preferences
- Check memory usage during animations

### 7. **Accessibility Testing:**
- Enable reduced motion in OS settings
- Verify animations are disabled or simplified
- Test keyboard navigation with animations
- Check screen reader compatibility
- Verify focus states are visible during animations

## Expected Animation Behavior:

### **Hero Section:**
- Parallax background moves at 0.3x scroll speed
- Key features stagger in with 200ms delays
- Role selection cards have hover lift effects
- CTA buttons have magnetic hover and glow effects
- Social proof indicators pulse continuously

### **About Section:**
- Statistics counters animate when scrolled into view
- Values cards stagger in with 150ms delays
- Team members reveal with 100ms delays
- All cards have hover lift and shadow effects
- Profile images have subtle hover animations

### **General Animations:**
- All scroll animations use intersection observer
- Smooth cubic-bezier easing for natural feel
- GPU-accelerated transforms for performance
- Respects user's reduced motion preferences
- Consistent timing and easing across components

## Animation Timing & Easing:

### **Entrance Animations:**
- Duration: 600ms - 1000ms
- Easing: `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)` (ease-out)
- Stagger delays: 100ms - 200ms
- Threshold: 10% element visibility

### **Hover Animations:**
- Duration: 200ms - 300ms
- Easing: `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)`
- Transform: `translateY(-4px)` for lift
- Scale: `1.05` - `1.1` for emphasis

### **Counter Animations:**
- Duration: 2000ms
- Easing: Cubic ease-out function
- Update frequency: 60fps via requestAnimationFrame
- Trigger: 50% element visibility

### **Parallax Effects:**
- Speed: 0.3x - 0.5x scroll speed
- Update: requestAnimationFrame for smoothness
- Disabled: When reduced motion is preferred
- Performance: GPU-accelerated transforms

## Performance Metrics:

### **Target Performance:**
- 60fps during animations
- <16ms frame time
- Minimal layout thrashing
- Smooth scroll performance
- Low memory usage

### **Optimization Techniques:**
- `transform` and `opacity` only for animations
- `will-change` property for animated elements
- Passive event listeners for scroll
- RequestAnimationFrame for smooth updates
- Intersection Observer for efficient triggering

The animation system provides a premium, engaging experience while maintaining excellent performance and accessibility standards across all devices and user preferences.
